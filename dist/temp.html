          <h2>Establishment of Jonestown and Population Growth (1870 to 1900)</h2>
          <p>The African Americans who settled in Orlando after the Civil War built on the resiliency and courage that had carried them through slavery to embrace the promises of citizenship and hope for a life that would be built on family, education, a community of faith, and economic opportunity to meet their needs and to accumulate generational wealth. The first pioneers whose names we see in the 1870 census likely already lived in the area before the Civil War as enslaved people [link to slave schedule] or as self-emancipated people who had fled plantations in Florida, Georgia, or South Carolina.  The census record shows their humble beginnings as “laborers,” “domestics,” and “cooks.”  [link to 1870 census]</p>
          <p>By the 1880s and 1890s the census and city directories data document the growth in population, the number of legal marriages (which were not permitted under slavery), and the spatial expansion from the single neighborhood of Jonestown to new housing construction in what was called West Orlando.  The housing groups were named for the white builders—Parramore, Hopper, etc.  [be sure we get all the various groups. Unlike West Orlando housing, Jonestown homes were not named for the builder, Magruader, but for two Black residents, Sam and Penny Jones.</p>

          <h2>Churches (1880 to 1900)</h2>
          <p>Enslaved people found strength in their faith, a faith that promised freedom, quite apart from the obedience white ministers preached and planters endorsed.  They carried their faith into emancipation and quickly built churches, first as brush arbors and later as wooden structures before erecting modern brick and mortar buildings that continue to minister to congregations today.

          <h2>Schools (1886 - 1921)</h2>
          <p>Throughout the era of slavery, enslaved people found ways to access education. Although teaching an enslaved person to read and write was prohibited by law in every state, slave narratives collected in the 1930s refer to individuals who could read and write and who educated others.  The papers of Reconstruction era Freedmen’s Bureau agents include observations on the eagerness of emancipated men and women for education.  Reading, writing, and basic arithmetic were essential skills for work and participation in civic life.  The census and city directory data show the presence of a school, Orlando Black (or sometimes called Orlando Colored) school by the mid-1880s.  This school moved to West Orlando and became Johnson Academy.   In 1921, Jones High School was constructed at 101 Parramore.  The school graduated its first class in 1931.

          <h2>Creating a Civic Community (1868 - 1894)</h2>
          <p>Florida returned to the Union in 1868, the same year the 14th Amendment was ratified defining citizenship.  Black Orlandans embraced their civic responsibilities and came to the courthouse to vote but were “whipped” and denied access to the ballot.  In 1885, Florida added a poll tax to its constitution, a move that was widely recognized as a method of eliminating the Black vote.  The list of Black electors (voters) from 1890 shows the linkage between Black businessmen and access to the ballot.  [Link to voter list] </p>

          <h2>Black Entrepreneurship (1880 - 1920)</h2>
          <p>Black entrepreneurs defied Jim Crow. They demonstrated their abilities to find methods to build businesses to provide goods and services to Black customers, create generational wealth for their families, and, with ministers, doctors, dentists, and attorneys, provide leadership that both challenged segregation and disfranchisement and protected vulnerable members of the community. Their businesses ranged from the readily acknowledged examples of funeral homes, barber and beauty shops, and insurance companies, to real estate, construction, service stations, and printing companies. They operated theaters and restaurants, sold groceries and dry goods, and produced tailored suits. They joined local branches of the NAACP, the Urban League, and the National Negro Business League. Some organized local Negro Chambers of Commerce. They defied the limitations Jim Crow imposed and laid groundwork for the mid-twentieth-century civil rights movement and beyond.</p>
