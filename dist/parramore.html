                        <h1>Part 2: Parramore, 1890 - 1945</h1>
                        <p>The development of West Orlando and the Parramore commercial district moved in tandem with the growth of the City of Orlando.  The 1900 US Census did not list Orlando as an urban area since it had a population of less than 2500.  By 1920, Orlando had the appearance of a progressive New South City: access to the Atlantic Coast Railroad, construction of airfields, public transportation, paved or brick streets, schools, libraries, a new post office with home delivery, department stores, movie theaters, parks, and beautification of white residential areas.  It also had the racial infrastructure of the New South: segregation of public and commercial, educational, health, and entertainment spaces as well as laws designed to disfranchise African American voters.  </p>

                            <p>The Jonestown community lived along the banks of Fern Creek in an area defined by East Jackson Street to the north, Palmer Street to the south, Williams Street to the east, and Mills Street to the west. White business owner James Baily Magruder built cabins in Jonestown to house workers for his multiple businesses that included the Empire Hotel, the Lucerne Theater, the Arcade, an apartment house, three restaurants, a livery business, a farm, an orange grove, and a business that produced "Magruder's Liniment," a topical medicine for horses. Unlike other white builders who named Black neighborhoods using their own last names and attaching the word "Quarters," a term from plantation enslavement, Magruder named the area Jonestown for Samuel and Penny Jones.</p>
