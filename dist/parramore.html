                        <p>The development of West Orlando and the Parramore commercial district moved in tandem with the growth of the City of Orlando.  The 1900 US Census did not list Orlando as an urban area since it had a population of less than 2500.  By 1920, Orlando had the appearance of a progressive New South City: access to the Atlantic Coast Railroad, construction of airfields, public transportation, paved or brick streets, schools, libraries, a new post office with home delivery, department stores, movie theaters, parks, and beautification of white residential areas.  It also had the racial infrastructure of the New South: segregation of public and commercial, educational, health, and entertainment spaces as well as laws designed to disfranchise African American voters.  </p>
