            <h1>Black Entrepreneurship in the Parramore Neighborhood of Orlando, 1870-2020</h1>
            <p>Black entrepreneurs defied Jim Crow.  
              White rhetoric acknowledged the end of chattel slavery but expected Blacks to occupy the lowest levels of the economy and provide labor for the most physically taxing and dirtiest jobs. . . and to do so without protest.  As they did in other southern cities, Orlando’s white businessmen constructed cabins for Black workers in locations convenient to their jobs.  Their intentions and expectations were codified in language adapted from slavery, frequently referring to these groupings of cabins as “quarters.”   There is no indication that they expected Black workers to form viable communities with schools, churches, businesses, and professionals.</p>

            <p>Within a decade of emancipation, African Americans developed businesses that supported the needs of small Black communities as contractors, grocers, morticians, laundries, and skilled tradesmen.  By the turn of the century Black communities in cities like Orlando supported a growing professional class that included college educated teachers, physicians, dentists, and attorneys. A small, but important middle class emerged in urban Black communities across the South. </p>
            <p>Black entrepreneurs were also constrained in their progress by segregation laws and disfranchisement.  Segregation limited their consumer base.  Blacks faced discrimination as they shopped in white stores, and with few exceptions, whites did not purchase goods and services from Black entrepreneurs. Blacks were also shut out of the market for capital.  Banks did not lend money to Black entrepreneurs.  As a result, businesses in the Black community were small, and storeowners purchased goods to stock their shelves from local, regional, and national distributors who could, and sometimes did, use their power of access to exert control during moments of protest for Black political and economic empowerment. </p>
            <p>The story of Black entrepreneurship in Orlando begins with Jonestown, where formerly enslaved Americans first built community and then defied Jim Crow by becoming entrepreneurs.</p>

            <h1>Part 1: Jonestown, 1870-1950</h1>
            <p>The African Americans who settled in Orlando after the Civil War built on the resiliency and courage that had carried them through slavery to embrace the promises of citizenship and hope for a life that would be built on family, education, a community of faith, and economic opportunity to meet their needs and to accumulate generational wealth. Many of the first pioneers whose names we see in the 1870 census likely already lived in the area before the Civil War as enslaved people] or as self-emancipated people who had fled plantations in Florida, Georgia, or South Carolina.  The census record shows their humble beginnings as “laborers,” “domestics,” and “cooks.” </p>
            <p>By the 1880s and 1890s the census and city directories data document the growth in population, the number of legal marriages (which were not permitted under slavery), and the spatial expansion from the single neighborhood of Jonestown to new housing construction in what was called West Orlando.  </p>
            <p>The development of Black entrepreneurship went hand in hand with the creation of sustainable community, including stable families, schools, churches, and social organizations.  This happened first in Jonestown before expanding to West Orlando and the Parramore neighborhood.</p>
