            <h1>Black Entrepreneurship in the Parramore Neighborhood of Orlando, 1870-2020</h1>
            <p>Black entrepreneurs defied Jim Crow.</p>
            <p>White rhetoric acknowledged the end of chattel slavery but expected Blacks to occupy the lowest levels of the economy and provide labor for the most physically taxing and dirtiest jobs. . . and to do so without protest.  As they did in other southern cities, Orlando's white businessmen constructed cabins for Black workers in locations convenient to their jobs.  Their intentions and expectations were codified in language adapted from slavery, frequently referring to these groupings of cabins as "quarters."   There is no indication that they expected Black workers to form viable communities with schools, churches, businesses, and professionals.</p>

          <p>Within a decade of emancipation, African Americans developed businesses that supported the needs of small Black communities as contractors, grocers, morticians, laundries, and skilled tradesmen.  By the turn of the century Black communities in cities like Orlando supported a growing professional class that included college educated teachers, physicians, dentists, and attorneys. A small, but important middle class emerged in urban Black communities across the South.</p>
          <p>Black entrepreneurs were also constrained in their progress by segregation laws and disfranchisement.  Segregation limited their consumer base.  Blacks faced discrimination as they shopped in white stores, and with few exceptions, whites did not purchase goods and services from Black entrepreneurs. Blacks were also shut out of the market for capital.  Banks did not lend money to Black entrepreneurs.  As a result, businesses in the Black community were small, and storeowners purchased goods to stock their shelves from local, regional, and national distributors who could, and sometimes did, use their power of access to exert control during moments of protest for Black political and economic empowerment.</p>
          <p> The story of Black entrepreneurship in Orlando begins with Jonestown, where formerly enslaved Americans first built community and then defied Jim Crow by becoming entrepreneurs.</p>
